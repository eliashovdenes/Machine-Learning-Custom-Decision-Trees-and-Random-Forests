## Introduction
This project implements custom decision tree and random forest classifiers from scratch, comparing them with scikit-learn's implementations. We tested our models on wine and coffee datasets, focusing on classifier performance and hyperparameter tuning. 

This was a school project for [Inf264](https://www4.uib.no/emner/INF264) course.


## Report Highlights

Data analysis of wine and coffee datasets
Detailed explanation of decision tree and random forest implementations
